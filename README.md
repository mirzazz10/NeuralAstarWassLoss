# NeuralAstarWassLoss

This is a project which implements Wassertein loss for Neural A star path planning algorithm 
Steps to reproduce: 
  1) Import data using planning dataset.
  2) Train the data using scripts/train.py.
  3) Test the data using test.py and can test an example using test_example.py in scripts folder.
